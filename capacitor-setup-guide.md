# Creating a Real Mobile App with Capacitor

## What is Capacitor?
Capacitor is a cross-platform native runtime that makes it easy to build web apps that run natively on iOS, Android, and Progressive Web Apps with full access to native device features.

## Step-by-Step Setup for Your Legal Doc Scan AI App

### 1. Install Capacitor Dependencies
```bash
npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli @capacitor/ios @capacitor/android
```

### 2. Initialize Capacitor
```bash
npx cap init
```
When prompted, use these values:
- **App ID**: `app.lovable.legaldocscanai` 
- **App Name**: `Legal Doc Scan AI`

### 3. Configure Capacitor
The setup will create a `capacitor.config.ts` file. Update it with:
```typescript
import { CapacitorConfig } from '@capacitor/core';

const config: CapacitorConfig = {
  appId: 'app.lovable.legaldocscanai',
  appName: 'Legal Doc Scan AI',
  webDir: 'dist',
  server: {
    androidScheme: 'https'
  },
  plugins: {
    SplashScreen: {
      launchShowDuration: 2000,
      backgroundColor: "#ffffff",
      showSpinner: false
    }
  }
};

export default config;
```

### 4. Build Your Web App
```bash
npm run build
```

### 5. Add Native Platforms
```bash
# Add iOS platform (requires macOS with Xcode)
npx cap add ios

# Add Android platform (requires Android Studio)
npx cap add android
```

### 6. Sync Your Web Code to Native Projects
```bash
npx cap sync
```

### 7. Open Native IDEs and Build
```bash
# Open in Xcode (macOS only)
npx cap open ios

# Open in Android Studio
npx cap open android
```

## Publishing Your App

### For iOS (App Store):
1. Open the project in Xcode
2. Configure signing certificates
3. Build for release
4. Upload to App Store Connect
5. Submit for review

### For Android (Google Play):
1. Open the project in Android Studio
2. Generate signed APK/AAB
3. Upload to Google Play Console
4. Submit for review

## Benefits of Native App vs PWA:
- **Better Performance**: Native code execution
- **Full Device Access**: Camera, storage, notifications
- **App Store Distribution**: Discovery and credibility
- **Offline Capabilities**: Better caching and storage
- **Native UI**: Platform-specific look and feel
- **Push Notifications**: Real native notifications
- **Background Processing**: App can work in background

## Cost Considerations:
- **Development**: Free (Capacitor is open source)
- **App Store Fees**: 
  - Apple App Store: $99/year developer account
  - Google Play: $25 one-time registration fee
- **Native Development Tools**: Free (Xcode, Android Studio)

## Next Steps:
1. Install the dependencies listed above
2. Follow the setup steps
3. Test on device simulators
4. Prepare for app store submission
5. Set up app analytics and crash reporting
6. Implement native features like push notifications

Your Legal Doc Scan AI will become a real mobile app that users can download from app stores!
